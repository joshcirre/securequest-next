### Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading

A valid credit card is required for paying accounts unless your company pays for services annually, in which case payment via check or PayPal is acceptable. Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number.

The Help Scout Service is billed in advance in accordance with our pricing schedule. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, annual payments, or refunds for months unused with an open account, except in the case of our 30-day money back guarantee (see below). In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) income taxes. You agree to pay for any taxes that might be applicable to your use of the Help Scout Service or payments made by you in connection with your use of the Help Scout Service.

### 30-day money back guarantee

If for any reason, you are unhappy with your Help Scout purchase, we do offer a 30-day money back guarantee. If you decide not to use Help Scout in your business within 30 days from your first payment, you may request a full refund. This applies to both annual and monthly subscriptions.
