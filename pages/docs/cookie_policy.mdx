#### What's a cookie?

"[Cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie)" are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Help Scout Service and other websites.

#### What's a page tag?

"[Page tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug)," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website or email usage information, such as how many times a specific page or email has been viewed. Page tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Help Scout Service, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain page tags.

#### Does Help Scout use cookies, and why?

Yes. We use cookies to personalize your experience on the Help Scout websites (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Help Scout Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Help Scout Service), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Help Scout Service so that we can improve our offerings, and to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content. By using cookies and page tags together, we are able to improve the Help Scout Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.

Please be aware that this cookie policy does not govern the use of third-party websites or services or providers of third-party services.
