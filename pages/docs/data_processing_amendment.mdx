Data Processing Amendment (DPA)
-------------------------------

*Help Scout's Data Processing Amendment v. 1.5 (as of Oct, 2022).*

* * * * *

### Introduction to this Amendment

Processing personal data in a secure, fair, and transparent way is extremely important to us at Help Scout. As part of this effort, we process personal data in accordance with EU Data Protection Laws including EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("EU GDPR"), 'and UK Data Protection Laws, including the GDPR in such form as incorporated into the laws of the United Kingdom (UK) by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 ("UK GDPR"), to the extent applicable'. We also process personal data in accordance with Non-EU and Non-UK Data Protection Laws governing the handling of various types of personal data including the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA"), and Payment card industry compliance ("PCI").

To better protect individuals' personal data, we are providing these terms to govern Help Scout's and your handling of personal data (the "Data Processing Amendment" or "DPA"). This DPA forms part of, and amends the Terms of Service ("ToS") and requires no further action on your part.

If you do not agree to this DPA, you may discontinue the use of the Help Scout service and cancel your account.

### Definitions

It is important that all parties understand what data and whose data is protected under this DPA. Each party has respective obligations to protect personal data; therefore, the following definitions explain the scope of this DPA and the mutual commitments to protect personal data.

*"Help Scout", "we", "us",* or *"our"* refers to the provider of the Help Scout website and services, (collectively referred to as the "Help Scout Service.").

*"You"* or *"Customer"* refers to the company or organization that signs up to use the Help Scout Service to manage the relationships with your consumers or service users.

*"Party"* refers to Help Scout and/or the customer depending on the context.

*"Personnel"* refers to those individuals who are employed by or are under contract to perform a service on behalf of one of the parties. Personnel may have rights in their personal data (including business contact information) if they reside in the EU. It is important to be clear about how personnel's rights are protected.

*"Sub-processor"* is a Third-party, independent contractors, vendors and suppliers who provide specific services and products related to the Help Scout website and our services, such as hosting, credit card processing and fraud screening, and mailing list hosting ("third-party" or "outside contractor" shall have similar meanings).

*"Incident"* means: (a) a complaint or a request with respect to the exercise of an individual's rights under the GDPR; (b) an investigation into or seizure of the personal data by government officials, or a specific indication that such an investigation or seizure is imminent; or (c) any breach of the security and/or confidentiality as set out in this DPA leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the personal data, or any indication of such breach having taken place or being about to take place.

The terms, *"Data Subject"*, *"Personal Data"*, *"Member State"*, *"Controller"*, *"Processor"*, and *"Processing"* shall have the same meaning as in the GDPR, and their cognate terms shall be construed accordingly.

*'Data Protection Law'* means all applicable legislation relating to data protection and privacy including without limitation the EU GDPR, (together with any national implementing laws in any Member State of the European Union or, to the extent applicable, in any other country), the UK GDPR, and the Swiss Federal Act of 19 June 1992 on Data Protection, the Ordinance to the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection and the revised Swiss Federal Act of 25 September 2020 on Data Protection which comes into force on 01 January 2023 (together the "Swiss FADP"); each as amended, repealed, consolidated or replaced from time to time

*'EU Standard Contractual Clauses'* means the Annex to the European Commission's decision of 4 June 2021 on Standard Contractual Clauses for transfer of personal data to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection pursuant to the GDPR

*'UK International Data Transfer Addendum'* means the UK International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (version B.1.0) issued by the UK Information Commissioner and laid before Parliament in accordance with s119A of the Data Protection Act 2018 on 2 February 2022 (as it is revised under its Section 18) to facilitate the international transfer of Personal Data in compliance with the UK GDPR.

For the sake of readability, we do not use initial capitalization of defined terms in this DPA. Defined terms are defined terms, irrespective of their format.

### 1\. Undertakings regarding personal data

1.  Each party agrees that personal data shall be treated as confidential information under this DPA. In addition, each party shall at all times comply with applicable laws relating to data protection in the relevant jurisdiction with respect to each other's personal data.
2.  Personal Data shall remain the property of the disclosing party. Help Scout acknowledges that customer is the controller and maintains control over data subject's personal data.
3.  Help Scout will process customer's personal data only to the extent strictly necessary for the purpose of providing the services in accordance with the ToS and any further written instructions from the customer that are mutually agreed upon in writing. The details of the processing of personal data as required by Article 28(3) GDPR are set out at Annex B. Help Scout agrees that:
    1.  it will implement and maintain a reasonable and appropriate security program comprising adequate security, technical and organizational measures to protect against unauthorized, unlawful or accidental processing, use, erasure, loss or destruction of, or damage to, customer personal data;
    2.  it will not modify, alter, delete, publish or disclose any customer personal data to any third party, nor allow any third party to process such personal data on Help Scout's behalf unless the third party is bound to similar confidentiality and data handling provisions;
    3.  it shall ensure that access to personal data is limited to those personnel who require such access to perform its obligations under the ToS, and its personnel engaged in the processing of personal data are informed of the confidential nature of the personal data, have received appropriate training on their responsibilities and have executed written confidentiality agreements. Help Scout shall ensure that such confidentiality obligations survive the termination of the personnel engagement; and
    4.  it will only process customer personal data to the extent necessary to perform its obligations under the ToS, upon written instructions of the customer (only as mutually agreed upon), and in accordance with applicable laws.
4.  Upon termination of your account, Help Scout will delete, or at customer's request, return all personal data in accordance with our standard backup and retention policy per the ToS, normally, no later than 90 days, unless we are required to retain personal data due to Union, Member State or United States laws; in which case Help Scout reserves the right to retain personal data.
5.  The parties acknowledge that customer may from time to time be in possession of personal data relating to Help Scout's personnel in connection with the use of the Help Scout Service. Help Scout warrants that it has provided to such personnel all necessary notifications and obtained all necessary consents, authorizations, approvals and/or agreements as required under any applicable law in order to enable: (i) the disclosure of Help Scout's personnel personal data to customer in connection with the customer's use of the Help Scout Service; and (ii) further processing of such Help Scout personal data by customer for the purpose of using the Help Scout Service.

### 2\. Undertakings regarding sub-processors

1.  The parties acknowledge that Help Scout may engage third-party sub-processors in connection with the obligations of the ToS. For any sub-processor with which Help Scout engages, we will enter into a written agreement containing data protection obligations no less protective than those in this amendment and as required to protect customer's personal data to the standard required by the GDPR
2.  Help Scout shall make available to customer the current list of sub-processors by posting that list online at: <https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/sub-processors/>. Help Scout shall notify customer in writing, including by email if it adds or removes sub-processors at least 10 days prior to any such changes if customer opts in to receive such notifications by signing up [here](https://www.helpscout.com/company/legal/sub-processors/). Customer may object to a new sub-processor appointment or replacement, provided such objection is based on reasonable grounds related to data protection. Help Scout will use reasonable efforts to work in good faith with customer to find an acceptable, reasonable, alternate solution. If the parties are not able to agree to an alternate solution, customer may suspend or terminate their account.
3.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that customer is solely responsible for subscribing to notifications of sub-processors as set out above. Help Scout shall have no obligation to inform customer of any new sub-processors in case of failure by customer to subscribe to such notifications pursuant to this Section 2.b.
4.  For the avoidance of doubt, the above authorization to the engagement of sub-processors constitutes customer's prior written consent to the sub-processing by Help Scout for purposes of Clause 9 of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

### Section 3 - Local Laws and Obligations in case of access by public authorities

### Clause 14

#### Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses

1.  The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
2.  The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:
    1.  the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;
    2.  the laws and practices of the third country of destination-- including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities -- relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards;
    3.  ) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
3.  The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses
4.  The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
5.  The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a).
6.  Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.

2.  If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
3.  Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of thecontract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

### Clause 16

#### Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination

1.  The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason.
2.
